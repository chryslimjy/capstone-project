Problem Formulation:

State the problem:

Certain groups of people unable to use the keyboard. Disabled/temporary injury. Or some prefer to use it for convenience sakeã€‚ Traditional web browsing interfaces rely heavily on manual input through keyboards, mice, or touchscreens, limiting accessibility and efficiency, especially for users with mobility impairments or in situations where hands-free operation is necessary. Moreover, navigating complex web content through these interfaces can be time-consuming and cumbersome. Therefore, there is a need for a more intuitive and efficient solution that allows users to interact with web browsers using natural language commands and voice input. This solution should enable users to navigate, search, interact with, and control web content seamlessly through spoken instructions, enhancing accessibility and usability for all users across various devices and platforms.
